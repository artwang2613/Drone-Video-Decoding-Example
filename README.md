This app is the updated, semi-final result of my summer project. I used YOLOv3 to attempt to recognize people from my DJI Mavic 2 Pro's camera. To save some time I built the functionality on top of DJI's own video decoding example project. 

I learned a lot through this process including android app programming, working with OpenCV(Java), and how YOLOv3 works. There is still a lot for me to learn and I'll likely take up this project again to improve the functionality. Currently, the drone recognizes me as a person around 20% of the time, not amazing at all.
